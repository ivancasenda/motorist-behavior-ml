    """
    Computes the forward pass for an affine (fully-connected) layer.

    The input x has shape (N, d_1, ..., d_k) and contains a minibatch of N
    examples, where each example x[i] has shape (d_1, ..., d_k). We will
    reshape each input into a vector of dimension D = d_1 * ... * d_k, and
    then transform it to an output vector of dimension M.

    Inputs:
    - x: A numpy array containing input data, of shape (N, d_1, ..., d_k)
    - w: A numpy array of weights, of shape (D, M)
    - b: A numpy array of biases, of shape (M,)
